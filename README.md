# Password-Manager
This password manager project was created to give myself practical experience in cybersecurity concepts. I was learning about Information Security Policies and was inspired by some learning material explaining the need for password policies in company environments to avoid brute-force attacks and minimize the risk of unauthorized use.

Based on Gibraltar Solutions, there are 12 Must-Have elements of a Password Policy

1) Password Length
  - Center for Internet Security (CIS) recommends that passwords should be at least 14 characters long with no limit on the      enforced maximum number of characters. A long password provides the greatest protection against brute force attacks.
3) Password Complexity vs Passphrases
  - passphrases are emerging as the smarter, more user-friendly alternative to traditional complex passwords
  - both memorable and far more secure than a short, complex password like “P@ssw0rd123.”
4) Password Banning
  - Organizations should ban common bad passwords to reduce susceptibility to brute force and password-spraying attacks.
5) Password Expiration
  - Instead, it is recommended that passwords should only be changed if they have been compromised or forgotten. 
6) MFA
  - In addition to a password, a user must provide another form of authentication to access an account, such as a fingerprint      or a one-time code sent to a different device.
7) Password History
  - A password history policy determines the number of unique new passwords that must be associated with a user account before     the user can reuse old passwords.
8) Password Reuse
  - While creating and managing multiple passwords seems like a hassle, users should always use different passwords across         multiple accounts.
9) Password Sharing
  - Password sharing makes your personal and professional data vulnerable to cybersecurity threats and should be avoided at        all times.
10) Failed Login Attempts
  - CIS recommends a temporary account lockout (15 minutes or more) after five consecutive failed attempts or time-doubling        throttling (in minutes) between each retry (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.).
12) Suspend Accounts Not In Use
  - Administrators should immediately disable accounts for people no longer authorized
14) Password Storage
  - A password manager app is the preferred option for password storage
15) Password Screening
  - Block passwords that are known to be frequently used or compromised
